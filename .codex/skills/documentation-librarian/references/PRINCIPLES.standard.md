# PRINCIPLES.standard.md — Principles / Invariants Standard

## Purpose

Principles define **how we think and decide**. They are stable constraints and heuristics that shape architecture, product, and operations.

## Audience

* Contributors making decisions
* Reviewers assessing consistency
* Newcomers learning project philosophy

## Source of truth

* Team alignment and accepted decisions
* ADRs for concrete examples

## Required sections

1. **Scope**

   * what these principles govern
2. **Principles**

   * each as:

     * Statement (short)
     * Rationale (short)
     * Implications (what this changes in practice)
     * Examples (optional)
3. **Non-principles**

   * things we explicitly do not care about (optional but valuable)
4. **Change policy**

   * how principles are updated (rare, explicit)

## Style rules

* Short, sharp, testable statements.
* Avoid vague vibes (“clean”, “modern”) without meaning.

## Allowed content

* Links to ADRs that exemplify the principle
* Explicit tradeoffs

## Forbidden content

* Implementation details (SPEC/Reference)
* Step-by-step instructions (Guides/Playbooks)

## Maintenance rules

* Changes require strong justification.
* Do not churn wording unless meaning changes.

## Quality checklist

* Principles are actionable and constrain choices.
* They are consistent with observed decisions.

## Common failure modes

* Principles become slogans
* Too many principles → none matter
