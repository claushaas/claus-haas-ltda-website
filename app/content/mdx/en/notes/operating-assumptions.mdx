# Operating assumptions

These are short placeholders that I can refine later. The intent is explicit.

## What I assume by default

- Clear objective and constraints
- A written decision log for key choices
- Small, reversible steps over big rewrites
- Documentation that matches what ships

## What I avoid

- Ambiguity that hides risk
- Work that cannot be validated
- Over-engineering before learning

## How to use this note

Treat this as a living list. Update it when the system changes.
